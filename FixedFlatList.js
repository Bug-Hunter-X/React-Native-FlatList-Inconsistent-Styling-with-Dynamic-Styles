The issue lies in how dynamic styles are applied and updated.  The `BuggyFlatList.js` example likely calculates styles inefficiently or fails to consider re-renders correctly. The solution in `FixedFlatList.js` ensures that style calculations are performed correctly within the item rendering logic and that React Native's efficient re-rendering mechanism is utilized. This often involves using the `useMemo` hook to memoize expensive calculations or ensuring that style changes correctly trigger re-renders.  The key is to make sure the styles are correctly generated for each item, and that React Native re-renders the item when those styles change.  Avoid directly calculating styles inside the `renderItem` function whenever possible, especially if those calculations depend on data that might change frequently.
