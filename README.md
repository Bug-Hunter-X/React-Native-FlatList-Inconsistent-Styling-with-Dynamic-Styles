This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Native's FlatList component. When attempting to apply dynamic styles based on item index or data within the FlatList, inconsistencies can arise. This often occurs due to improper style prop handling or incorrect calculations based on the item's properties. The `BuggyFlatList.js` file showcases the problematic implementation, leading to unpredictable styling across list items. The `FixedFlatList.js` file provides a corrected solution.  The issue is not necessarily an error thrown by React Native itself but rather an outcome of incorrect style management in the rendering logic.
